# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-11)

**Core value:** SO-101 + SmolVLA remote inference must run stably while producing trustworthy communication metrics that can be used for wireless communication experiments.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Package And Environment Baseline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Package And Environment Baseline)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-11 -- Phase 1 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Use LeRobot official async inference as the v1 transport path.
- Initialization: Build a small `so101_remote/` package with thin entrypoints.
- Initialization: Keep v1 lightweight and avoid a highly integrated platform.
- Initialization: Treat communication metrics and environment setup as first-class deliverables.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GSD subagents are not installed; planning and roadmap initialization were completed inline.
- Real hardware and LeRobot runtime validation still require the target server/robot environments.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Teleoperation | Integrate legacy teleoperation into the new runtime/metrics framework | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Reporting | Charts, plots, and multi-run comparison | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Configuration | Full YAML configuration and CLI override system | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
| Integrations | Real PI-series policy adapter and second robot arm adapter | Deferred to v2 | Initialization |
